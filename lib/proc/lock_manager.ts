// LockManager is responsible for granting locks to tasks. Each lock corresponds
// to a database table.
//
// Four types of locks exist in order to implement a two-phase locking
// algorithm.
// 1) RESERVED_READ_ONLY: Multiple such locks can be granted. It prevents any
//    RESERVED_READ_WRITE and EXCLUSIVE locks from being granted. It needs to be
//    acquired by any task that wants to eventually escalate it to a SHARED
//    lock.
// 2) SHARED: Multiple shared locks can be granted (meant to be used by
//    READ_ONLY tasks). Such tasks must be already holding a RESERVED_READ_ONLY
//    lock.
// 3) RESERVED_READ_WRITE: Granted to a single READ_WRITE task. It prevents
//    further SHARED, RESERVED_READ_ONLY and RESERVED_READ_WRITE locks to be
//    granted, but the underlying table should not be modified yet, until the
//    lock is escalated to an EXCLUSIVE lock.
// 4) EXCLUSIVE: Granted to a single READ_WRITE task. That task must already be
//    holding a RESERVED_READ_WRITE lock. It prevents further SHARED or
//    EXCLUSIVE locks to be granted. It is OK to modify a table while holding
//    such a lock.
